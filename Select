Select

The sql syntax at its simplest form is a SELECT Statement followed by a FROM Statement. 
Select is an integral part of the SQL Sytax and many SQL queires will have a Select in the statement. 
The most common operation in SQL, the query, makes use of the declarative SELECT statement. 
SELECT retrieves data from one or more tables, or expressions. Standard SELECT statements have no persistent effects on the database


Note: SELECT is the same as select or Select


Example 1:

  Select 
    Customer ID,
    Customer Name,
    Age,
    Address,
    State
  From Customer_Table



The select is used to select columns from a table. The data selected is then stored in a result-set. If a table uses a column which you want to rename. 
the column name can be renamed as the following Column Name as Column Name2. For example, I want to change the Customer name column to Name Column. You can do the following example:


Example:
  Select 
    Customer ID,
    Customer Name as Name,
    Age,
    Address,
    State
  From Customer_Table



To return a table and all the columns use the * symbol. So to return all columns in a table, we would use the following snippet:


Select * from Table Name


Select Distinct

The statement Select Distinct statement only returns the unique values into your result set.
