Where Clause


The where clause is used to filter records. Think of it is only selecting the records which meet certain qualifications.
Where clause is one of the best tools for removing excess data from a table. 
The where clause is optional in a query and specifies which data values or rows will be returned or displayed based on the criteria described after the keyword where.
The where clause uses following logical operators to help set the criteria:


=  equals
> greater than
< l ess than
>= greater than or equal
< less than or equal
<> not equal
Between Between a certain range
like searches a patter
in to specify multiple possible values
like (Check the 'Like' Section to see more on this)

for example:


Select


Select
First Name,
Last Name,
Company
from Customer Names
Where Last Name = ‘Smith’




The query will only return the records where the last name column is equal to 'Smith'
