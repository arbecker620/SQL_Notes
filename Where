Where Clause


The where clause is used to filter records. Think of it is only selecting the records which meet certain qualifications.
Where clause is one of the best tools for removing excess data from a table. 
The where clause is optional in a query and specifies which data values or rows will be returned or displayed based on the criteria described after the keyword where.
The where clause uses following logical operators to help set the criteria:


=  : equals
>  : greater than
<  : less than
>= : greater than or equal
<  : less than or equal
<>  : not equal
Between  : Between a certain range
like : searches a patter
in   : to specify multiple possible values
like : (Check the 'Like' Section to see more on this)

for example:


Select


Select
First Name,
Last Name,
Company
from Customer Names
Where Last Name = ‘Smith’




The query will only return the records where the last name column is equal to 'Smith'. 


Helpful tip: The where statement is a chance to limit record being returns specific to the query you are building. When building a query use a where clause as the following: 'These are the items I am looking for' and not 'Bring me all records' to look at. By analyzing your where clause and what you are looking for this helps your execution plan as you can eliminate redundant data. 

In our example above we returns only customer records with the last name of 'Smith'. To return records with the name 'Smith' and 'Baker' we can use the logical operator of OR.So to return the Smith and Baker customers we can do the following:


Select
First Name,
Last Name,
Company
from Customer Names
Where Last Name = ‘Smith’ or Last Name = 'Baker'



Another way to write this is using the 'in' logical operator. The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions.


Select
First Name,
Last Name,
Company
from Customer Names
Where Last Name in ( ‘Smith’,' Baker')


Using the In operator presents a clearer and concise wasy to say you are wanting a certain list of terms to be returned. The word NOT  can be used in the WHERE clause with IN to provide a 


For example, using the Customers above with SMITH and BAKER. We can rework out query to return the records where the client records are NOT SMITH or BAKER. We use the following query: 

Select
First Name,
Last Name,
Company
from Customer Names
Where Last Name not in ( ‘Smith’,' Baker')
