Joins

Join can be used dos combine rows from two or more tables with unique identifiers. Joins are one of the ways you can use to create more intricate results


example:


Select Application1.PolicyNumber, Application1.CustomerName, Application2.AgentNumber, Application2.AgentName
from Application1
join Dream on Application1.AgentNumber,  = Aplication2.AgentNumber



Many tables in our servers and db all connected by a common unique identifier. 

Join are a very powerful tool because of how much info you can bring together. There are different types of joins:

inner joins - Returns records that have matching values in both tables
left join returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right tables
right join returns all records from right tables and the matches records from the left table
full join returns all records where there is a match in either left or right table.
