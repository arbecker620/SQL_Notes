Joins

Join can be used dos combine rows from two or more tables with unique identifiers. Joins are one of the ways you can use to create more intricate results


example:


Select Application1.PolicyNumber, Application1.CustomerName, Application2.AgentNumber, Application2.AgentName
from Application1
join Dream on Application1.AgentNumber,  = Aplication2.AgentNumber



Many tables in our servers and db all connected by a common unique identifier. 

Join are a very powerful tool because of how much info you can bring together. There are different types of joins:

inner joins - Returns records that have matching values in both tables
left join returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right tables
right join returns all records from right tables and the matches records from the left table
full join returns all records where there is a match in either left or right table. 





INNER JOIN

The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the table 1 that do not have matches in table 2, these orders will not be shown!

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name


LEFT JOIN


The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2). The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name


RIGHT JOIN

The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table (table1). The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.


SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name


FULL JOIN

The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records. FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets


SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
